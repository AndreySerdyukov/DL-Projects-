# Deep Learning Projects with PyTorch

This folder contains my deep learning projects using PyTorch, covering various tasks such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Regression.

## Projects Included:

- **Computer Vision (CV)**: Projects involving image classification, object detection, and other visual tasks.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tasks related to text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.
- **Regression**: Projects applying deep learning models to regression problems.

## Libraries Used:
- PyTorch
- torchvision (for image processing)
- torchtext (for NLP tasks)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

## How to Run
```
git clone https://github.com/AndreySerdyukov/DL-projects
cd DL-projects
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
jupyter lab
```
