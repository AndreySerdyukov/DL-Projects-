# Deep Learning Projects: MNIST and Vegetable Classification

This folder contains two deep learning projects focused on image classification tasks:

1. **MNIST Digit Classification**  
   The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using neural networks. The model is trained to predict the correct digit (0-9) from images of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **Vegetable Classification**  
   This project aims to classify images of vegetables into predefined categories using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project explores various techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning.

## Key Steps

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Image augmentation (for the vegetable classification task)
- Model building and training
- Evaluation and tuning

## Libraries Used
- **PyTorch** for building and training the neural networks
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Torchvision** for image transformations and pretrained models
