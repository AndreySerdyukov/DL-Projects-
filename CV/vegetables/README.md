# Vegetable Image Classification with Neural Networks

This project aims to classify images of vegetables using neural networks. The task involves studying the dataset, preparing the data pipeline, applying data augmentation techniques, and using transfer learning or custom neural network architectures for classification.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of classifying different types of vegetables from images. The dataset consists of images of various vegetables, and the model is trained to recognize these images and assign them to the correct class.

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Preparation**:
    - Study the dataset, which includes images of various vegetables.
    - Prepare a data loader for efficient loading and batching of images during training and evaluation.
    - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Data Augmentation**:
    - To improve the generalization of the model, apply various data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and color jitter.
    - Use these techniques during training to increase the diversity of the training data without needing more labeled images.

3. **Modeling with Transfer Learning**:
    - Use pre-trained models (such as ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet) for transfer learning. Fine-tune the pre-trained models on the vegetable dataset to adapt the model to our specific task.
    - Evaluate the performance of transfer learning and compare it with the performance of a custom-built neural network.
    - If a custom neural network outperforms transfer learning, demonstrate it through validation results.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - Train the model on the training dataset, applying the appropriate loss function and optimization techniques.
    - Validate the model using the validation dataset to ensure good performance.
    - Test the model on the test dataset to evaluate its generalization.

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib (for plotting results)
- PIL (for image processing)
- scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

## Results

- The model should achieve good accuracy on the validation set and demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning.
- If a custom neural network architecture is developed, it should be compared with transfer learning results and show improvements on validation accuracy.
